new_xls.py
===========
+ need install python module : xlsxwriter
+ the scripts can generate chart auto
+ sh fioparse.sh *.out > out ; python new_xls can get the excel "test.xlsx"

test_all.sh
===========
	> all="1 2 4 8 16 32 64 128 256 512 1024"
	> for i in $all; 
	> do
	>	echo $i;
	>	sh fio.sh -r /dev/dm-12 -s 1000 -l $i -f -u 32
	>    sh fioparse.sh *.out > out
	>	python new_xls.py
	> done

+ you need modify devices name and set -s -l -f -u and so on



fio_scripts
===========

Theses scripts are for facilitating running the I/O benchmark tool
fio, parsing the fio data and graphing the output.
There are a lot of I/O benchmarking tools out there, most noteably
iozone and bonnie++, but fio seems to be the most flexible with
 the most active user community
 
 NOTE: the scripts work on fio 2.0.7 but possibly not on other versions

* fio project: http://freecode.com/projects/fio
* download: http://brick.kernel.dk/snaps/fio-2.0.7.tar.gz
* man page: http://linux.die.net/man/1/fio

files in this project

+ fio.sh - run a set of I/O benchmarks using fio
+ fioparse.sh - parse the output files from fio.sh runs
+ fio.r - create a function called graphit() in R
+ fiog.r  - run graphit on different combinations of data from fioparse.sh
+ fiop.r -  newer version of graphit that adds scaling info
+ fiopg.r - use to graph with the newer graphit in fiop.r
+ example data from fioparse.sh

	> data_emc.r   
	> data_ssd.r   
	> data_pharos.r   
	> data_mem.r   

NOTE: the scripts in this project require that you have already
downloaded fio and compiled a binary of fio.
The scripts also require version 2.0 of fio to work correctly.

Running fio.sh
---------------------------
First run fio.sh.
The script fio.sh will run a series of I/O benchmarks.
The series of I/O benchmarks are aimed at simulating the typical workload
of an Oracle database.
There are 3 types of I/O run

* random small reads
* sequential large reads
* sequential writes

for each of these the number of users is varied and the I/O request size is 
varied.


	usage: ./fio.sh  [options]
	
	run a set of I/O benchmarks
	
	OPTIONS:
	   -h              Show this message
	   -b  binary      name of fio binary, defaults to ./fio
	   -d  directory   work directory where fio creates a file and reads and writes, 
	                           default ./ (and default filename created is fiodata) 
	   -o  directory   results directory, where to put output files, defaults to ./
	   -t  tests       tests to run, defaults to readrand,read,write 
	                           options are
		                      readrand - IOPS test : 8k by 1,8,16,32 users
		                      read  - MB/s test : 1M by 1,8,16,32 users & 8k,32k,128k,1m by 1 user
	                      write - redo test, ie sync seq writes : 1k, 8k, 128k by 1 user
	                      randrw   - workload test: 8k read and write by 1,8,16,32 users
	   -s  seconds     seconds to run each test for, default 60
	   -m  megabytes   megabytes for the test I/O file to be used, default 8000 (ie 8G)
	   -i              individual file per process, default size 100m (overrides -m )
	   -f              force run, ie don't ask for confirmation on options
	   -c              force creation of work file otherwise if it exists we use it as is
	   -r raw_device   use named raw device instead of file
	   -u #users       force test to only use this many users
	   -l blocksize    force test to only use this blocksize in KB, ie 1-1024 
	   -e recordsize   use this recordsize if/when creating the zfs file system, default 8K
	
	       example
	                  fio.sh -b ./fio.opensolaris

Running fioparse.sh
---------------------------
Once the benchmarks have been run, use fioparse.sh to extract a consise
set of statistics from the output files.

Graphing in R
-----------------------------------------
To get started with R see: http://scs.math.yorku.ca/index.php/R:_Getting_started_with_R
QUICK START: To install R, you can go to http://cran.r-project.org/ and follow the instructions.

Start R and load up the above in R and it creates the dataframe "m"

In R we can now source "fio.r" which creates a function "graphit(m)"

	source("fio.r")        # create the graphit() function
	source("data_ssd.r")   # load some fio data, data_ssd.r is provided in github distro
	graphit(m)             # graph the data
	source("fiog.r")       # this will graph various combinations and save the png files 
	                       # to C:\temp
	                       # the graphs will be for readrand, read and write tests
	                       # the graphs will graph different user loads and I/O sizes in the data

By default it will graph 8K random reads.
If you source "fiog.r" it will run through a series of different combinations graphing them and saving the output.
The output is save to png files in the directory  C:\TMP

Example data files are included

* data_emc.r
* data_ssd.r
* data_pharos.r
* data_mem.r

collected from different systems. The EMC data is one single spindle. The pharos data is striped but
shared filer. THe ssd data is from two striped SSD devices. The mem data is from using /tmp where /tmp
is a memory filesystem.
In order to graph these datasets, simple source them

	source("data_ssd.r")

Then graph them

	source("fiog.r")

NOTE: to source files they have to be in R's working directory.
You can get the working directory with

	getwd()

you can set working directory with

	setwd("C:\\Temp\\")

for example to set it to C:\Temp
if the data is in a csv file you can load it with

        m <- read.csv("data_ssd.csv")

Running fiop.r and fiopg.r
-----------------------------------------------
new set of graphs with fiop.r version of graphit(). Use fiopg.r to create a set of graphs from a data set.
for example

	source("fiop.r")
	source("data_emc.r")
	source("fiopg.r")

Each PNG file will have 3 graphs

1. latency on a log scale
2. latency on a base 10 scale
3. throughout MB/s

1: the log scale latency has several parts
-------------------------------------------

Four lines:

1. max latency - dashed red line
2. 99% latency - top of light grey shaded area
3. 95% latency - top of dark grey shaded area
4. avg latency   - black line

Plus:

+ back ground is barchaerts, 0 percent at bottom to 100% at top

        light blue % of I/Os below 1ms - probably some sort of cache read
        green % of I/Os below 10ms
        yellow % of I/Os over 10ms

+  histograms of latency buckets 

	at each user load level, color coded. Each bugkets height (horizontal) is % of I/Os in that bucket
	like a fine grain breakdown of the background
   
2. base 10 latency
-------------------------------------------

       shows the average latency - black line
       the background is a type of scalling factor
                    blue means latency actually gets faster from one point to next
                    light red means it gets slower
                    darker red means latency gets slower and throughput actually decreases
            the hight of these bars is     (ratio of increase in latency)  / ratio of increase in users )
            for example if  1user was 1ms and 8 users was 8ms then that would be  (8users/1user)/(8ms/1ms)

3. the throughput bar chart, shows MB/s
-------------------------------------------

    the bars are color code with amount percentage of throughput that had a latency of that color where colors
    are in the right hand axis legend in top graph the latency on log scale

see: 

https://sites.google.com/site/oraclemonitor/i-o-graphics#TOC-percentile-latency-with-scaling


New Graphics
-----------------------------------------------------
a new version of the function graphit() is created by
fiop.r and fiopg.r will go through a set of I/O data
and print out variouis graphs of the data.

Examples of the graphs are on

A visual explanation is here

A Summary of the graph contents is:

The charts are mainly for exploring the data as opposed to a polished final graph showing I/O performance

A quick recap of the graphics:
There are 3 graphs

1.  latency on log graph
2. latency on base 10 graph
3. throughput bar charts

On the log latency graph latency is shown for

* max latency - dashed red line
* average latency - solid black line
* 95% latency - dash black line with grey fill between 95% and average
* 99% latency - dash black line with light grey fill between 95% and 99% latency
* latency histogram - buckets represent % of I/Os for that latency.Each bucket is drawn at the y axis height that represents that latency. The buckets are also color coded to help more quickly identify
* background color - for each load test the background is coded one of 3 colors. 
* ... yellow - % of I/Os over 10ms
* ... green - % of I/Os under 10ms
* ... blue - % of I/Os under 1ms

the idea being that  the graphs should have all green. If the backgrounds are yellow then the I/Os are slow. If the backgrounds are blue then the I/Os represent a certain about of cached reads as opposed to physical spindle reads. 


The second graph is latency on base 10 in order to more easily see the slopes of the increasing I/O latency with load.
On this second graph is also a bar chart in the background. The bars are color coded

* dark red - latency increased and throughput decreases
* light red - latency increased but throughput also increased
* light blue - latency actually got faster (shouldn't happen but does)

Ideally the bars are so small they aren't visible which means latency stays the same as load increases. The higher the bar the more the latency changed between tests

The third chart is simply the throughput, ie the MB/s. These bars have slices that represent the percentage of the I/O at the latency that corresponds to that color. The colors are defined in the legend of the top chart.
